### Assignment 2:

Assignment 1: Basic Image Classification
1. Dataset Exploration: Choose a simple image classification dataset (e.g., MNIST or Fashion-MNIST).
Write code to load and visualize the dataset.
2. Implementing a Basic Model: Build a simple neural network using libraries like TensorFlow or
PyTorch to classify the images. Train the model using the dataset and evaluate its accuracy.
3. Visualization of Model Results: Create a program to visualize the model&#39;s predictions on test images,
highlighting the correct and incorrect classifications.

Assignment 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
1. CNN Model Construction: Implement a CNN architecture using layers like convolutional, pooling,
and fully connected layers. Experiment with different layer configurations.
2. Data Augmentation: Augment the training dataset by applying transformations like rotation,
cropping, and flipping. Train the CNN model with augmented data and compare its performance.
3. Transfer Learning: Use a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) and fine-tune it for your
image classification task. Compare the performance with your custom-built model.

Assignment 3: Advanced Image Classification Techniques
1. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with hyperparameter tuning techniques like grid search or
random search to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for your image classification model.
2. Model Interpretability: Implement techniques to interpret and visualize the learned features in your
CNN model, such as feature maps, activation maximization, or Grad-CAM.
3. Ensemble Methods: Build an ensemble of multiple image classification models (e.g., CNN, SVM,
Random Forest) and combine their predictions to improve classification accuracy.

Assignment 4: Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning
1. Dataset Preprocessing: Choose a more complex image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or ImageNet).
Preprocess the dataset by resizing, normalizing, and splitting into training and validation sets.
2. Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models: Utilize pre-trained models like ResNet, Inception, or
EfficientNet for your dataset. Freeze certain layers, fine-tune others, and train the model.
3. Visualizing Transfer Learning Impact: Visualize the performance improvement obtained from transfer
learning compared to training a model from scratch.

Assignment 5: Handling Imbalanced Datasets
1. Dataset Imbalance Analysis: Choose a dataset with class imbalance. Analysed the distribution of
classes and determined the severity of the imbalance.
2. Data Augmentation for Imbalanced Data: Implement specific data augmentation techniques like
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset and train the model.
3. Evaluation Metrics for Imbalanced Data: Evaluate your model using metrics like precision, recall,
F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) that are suitable for imbalanced datasets.
